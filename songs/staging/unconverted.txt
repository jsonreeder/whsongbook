finally found all your courage to let it all go Remembering you falling into my arms Crying for the death of you heart You were stone white so delicate so lost in the cold You were always so lost in the dark  Remembering you how you used to be So drowned you were angels so much more than everything Hold for the last time then slip away quietly Open my eyes but I never see anything

pictures of you Never hold onto your heart Looking so long for the words to be true But always just breaking apart  my pictures of you  There is nothing in the world that I ever wanted more Than to feel you deep in my heart There was nothing in the world that I ever wanted more Than to never feel the breaking apart of my pictures of youPride and JoyStevie Ray Vaughan

  Its a hand-me-down, the thoughts are broken, Perhaps they're better left unsung. I dont know, dont really care Let there be songs to fill the air. Am                   D Ripple in still water,                      G                   C When there is no pebble tossed,           A          D Nor wind to blow.Reach out your hand if your cup be empty, If your cup is full may it be again, Let it be known there is a fountain, That was not made by the hands of men.  There is a road, no simple highway, Between the dawn and the dark of night, And if you go no one may follow, That path is for your steps alone.	(Chorus) You who choose to lead must follow But if you fall you fall alone, If you should stand then whos to guide you?  If I knew the way I would take you home. La da da da...Rivers of BabylonThe Melodians                           GBy the rivers of BabylonWhere we sat down                 DAnd there we wept                                      GWhen we remembered ZionGFor the wickedCarried us away captivity,      C                        GRequired from us a song.How can we sing King Alpha's song in aD           GStrange land?So let the                        DWords of our mouths,                      G                    DAnd the meditations of our hearts,          G                        DBe acceptable in Thy sight,           GHere tonight.(Repeat first two verses)How can we sing King Alpha's song in aStrange land?Rocket ManElton John and Bernie Taupin(Capo 3)Em                                               A  She packed my bags last night pre-flight Em                        A  Zero hour nine a.m. C                              G     Am                   D  And I'm gonna be hi-i-igh as a kite by then I miss the earth so much I miss my wife It's lonely out in space On such a ti-i-i-meless flight G                                                             C And I think it's gonna be a long long time         C                                                            GTill touch down brings me round again to find                       G                                C                      G/BI'm not the man they think I am at home, oh no no no           A                  C                                                          G          C  I'm a rocket man, rocket man, burning out his fuse up here aloneAnd I think it's gonna be a long long timeTill touch down brings me round again to findI'm not the man they think I am at home, oh no no no I'm a rocket man, rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids In fact it's cold as hell And there's no one there to raise them if you did And all this science I don't understand It's just my job five days a week A rocket man, a rocket man 	(Chorus)G                                                             CAnd I think it's gonna be a long long time     (x4)Without Capo:Verse: | Gm | C | Gm | C || Eb Bb | Cm | F | F |Chorus: | Bb | Eb | Bb | Eb || C | Eb | Bb | Eb |Rocky RaccoonThe BeatlesAm7  Now somewhere in the Black Mountain Hills of Dakota                                  D7sus                            D7 There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon G7                                                            C                  And one day his woman ran off with another guy, G/B                               Am7Hit young Rocky in the eye Rocky didn't like that He said I'm gonna get that boy So one day he walked into town Booked himself a room in the local saloon.  Rocky Raccoon checked into his room Only to find Gideon's Bible Rocky had come equipped with a gun To shoot off the legs of his rival His rival it seems had broken his dreams By stealing the girl of his fancy. Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil But everyone knew her as Nancy. Now she and her man who called himself Dan Were in the next room at the hoe down Rocky burst in and grinning a grin He said Danny boy this is a showdownBut Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot And Rocky collapsed in the corner. Now the doctor came in stinking of gin And proceeded to lie on the tableHe said Rocky you met your match, and Rocky said, Doc it's only a scratch And I'll be better I'll be better doc as soon as I am able. Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room Only to find Gideon's bible A Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt To help with good Rocky's revival.Guitar:---3-3-3----3-3-3----3-3-3---2-2-2---1-1-1---1-1-1----0-0-0---0-0-0-------1-1-1----1-1-1----1-1-1---1-1-1---0-0-0---0-0-0----0-0-0---0-0-0-------2-2-2----2-2-2----2-2-2---2-2-2---0-0-0---0-0-0----0-0-0---0-0-0--------------------------0--------0---------------------------------------------------0--------0-------------------------------------------------3-------2-----------------------------------------------------3-------3--------------------------------SanteriaSublime              E                                G#I don't practice Santeria.

EmShady Grove, my little love, I'm bound for Shady Grove.Wish I had a banjo string, made of golden twineEvery tune I play on it, I wish that girl was mineWish I had a needle and thread, so that I could sowSow that pretty girl to my side, and down the road I'd go.	(Chorus)Every night when I go home, my wife I try to please her,More I try, the worse she gets, damned if I don't leave her.Some come here to fiddle and dance, some come here to tarrySome come here to fiddle and dance, I come here to marry.	(Chorus)She'll be Comin' Round the MountainTraditional - RUS p. 177
