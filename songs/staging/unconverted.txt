And how come we're so hard?It's not always easy and sometimes life can be deceivingI'll tell you one thing it's always better when we're togetherBb                              C  Mmmm it's

light singsAnd brings new things, but tomorrow night you seeThat they'll be gone, too, too many things I have to doBut if all of these dreams might find their way into my day to day sceneIll be under the impression I was somewhere in betweenWith only two just me and you not so many things we got to do Or places we got to be, we'll sit beneath the mango treeYeah, it's always better when we're togetherMmmm, we're somewhere in between togetherWell, it's always better when we're togetherYeah, it's always better when we're togetherGm                  C

go wrong, go wrong with you, it hurts me, too.You love him more when you should love him less.I pick up behind him and take his mess.When things go wrong, go wrong with you, it hurts me, too.He love another woman and I love you,But you love him and stick to him like glue.When things go wrong, go wrong with you, it hurts me, too.Now you better leave him; he better put you down.Oh, I won't stand to see you pushed around.When things go wrong, go wrong with you, it hurts me, too. Johnny B.

How I always held close in your fear Remembering you running soft through the night You were bigger brighter and whiter than snow And screamed at the make-believe screamed at the sky And you finally found all your courage to let it all go Remembering you falling into my arms Crying for the death of you heart You were stone white so delicate so lost in the cold You were always so lost in the dark  Remembering you how you used to be So drowned you were angels so much more than everything Hold for the last time then slip away quietly Open my eyes but I never see anything

pictures of you Never hold onto your heart Looking so long for the words to be true But always just breaking apart  my pictures of you  There is nothing in the world that I ever wanted more Than to feel you deep in my heart There was nothing in the world that I ever wanted more Than to never feel the breaking apart of my pictures of youPride and JoyStevie Ray Vaughan

   BmAnd she feeds you tea and oranges that come all the way from China                  GAnd just when you mean to tell her that you have no love to give her                 AmThen she gets you on her wavelength, and she lets the river answer                    GThat you've always been her lover                  Bm                                                 CAnd you want to travel

he knew for certain only drowning men could see him He said "All men will be sailors then until the sea shall free them" But he himself was broken, long before the sky would open  Forsaken, almost human, he sank beneath your wisdom Like a stone  And you want to travel with him, and you want to travel blind  And you think maybe you'll trust him, for he's touched your perfect body with his mind Now Suzanne takes your hand and she leads you to the river She is wearing rags and feathers from Salvation Army counters And the sun pours down like honey on our lady of the harbour  And she shows you where to look among the garbage and the flowers There are heroes in the seaweed, there are children in the morning They are leaning out for love and they will lean that way forever While Suzanne holds the mirror  And you want to travel with her, and you want to travel blind And you know that you can trust her, for she's touched your perfect body with her mind Sweet Baby

the wheat fields waving, and the dust clouds rolling,A voice was chanting as the fog was lifting,This land was made for you and me.In the squares of the city by the shadow of the steepleNear the

private propertyBut on the other side it didn't say nothingThis land was made for you and me.Nobody living can ever stop meAs I go walking my freedom highwayNobody living can make me turn

knowWhere you just have to wish to make it so.And at night the stars they put on a show for freeAnd, darling, you can share it all with me.That right smack dab in the middle of townI found a paradise that's trouble-proof.And if this old world starts a getting you down,There's room enough for two, up on my roof.VincentDon McLean                      G   (Gsus4) G

I'll strap shoes on my feetGot to find a reasonReason things went wrongGot to find a reason why my Money's all gone.I got a dalmatian.I can still get high.I can play the guitar like a Mother fuckin' riotWell life is (too short) so love the one you gotCause you might get run over or you might get shotNever start no static, I just get it off my chestNever had to battle with no bullet proof vestTake a small example, take a tip from meTake all of your money, give it up to charityLove's what I got, is within my reach, andThe Sublime style still straight from Long Beach.It all comes back to you, you bound to get what you deserveTry and test that, you're bound to get servedLove's what I got, don't start a riotYou'll feel it when the dance gets hot  D    G

got, I gotI don't cry when my dog runs awayI don't get angry at the bills I have to payI don't get angry when my mom smokes potHits the bottle then goes back to the rockFuckin, fightin', it's all the sameLivin' with Louie dog's the only way to stay saneGive the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me(Chorus)What IfColpldayF#m           A                 Bm7    What if there was

never let your head hit the bed without my hand behind it 	(Pre-Chorus)      (Chorus) Dm/f   Damn baby    You frustrate me    I know you're mine all mine all mine    But you look so good it

not my family.  In your head, in your head they are fighting,  With their tanks and their bombs, and their bombs and their guns.  In your head, in your head, they are crying... In your head, in your head,  Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, What's in your head, in your head  Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie?...   Another mother's breakin',  Heart is taking over.  When the vi'lence causes silence,  We must be mistaken.   It's the same old theme since nineteen-sixteen.  In your head, in your head they're still fighting,  With their tanks and their bombs, and their bombs and their guns.  In your head, in your head, they are dying... 	(Chorus)346
